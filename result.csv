tonight, i say to the american people, to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough!
it is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
what is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the president to respond to iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
the second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in iraq.
but elections are not enough.
we know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
for a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.

we know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and iran’s nuclear ambitions.

i know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
we know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
in addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
and so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
as i said at the outset, i did not know my father well - he returned to kenya from america when i was still young.

certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary kenyans - we know how hard kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that kenyan mothers make for their children, the herculean efforts that kenyan fathers make for their families.

letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the sunni and shia to come to the table and find peace.
i know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.

but the record's clear: john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time.
senator mccain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
america, now is not the time for small plans.
it's time for us to change america.
now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
it’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
and it is time to refocus america’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
it is time to change our policy.
the time for waiting in iraq is over.
but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
it’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own.
it is time to give iraqis their country back.
in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time.
and this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
since that time i have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those i heard from my relatives here in kenya on my last trip to this country.
it can shield a war criminal - even one like felicien kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
the first time i came to kenya was in 1987.
they fight the fight of our time.
time and time again on the trip, i saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the russians.
today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
but we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from africa to afghanistan.
but this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
and if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as i see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as i sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then i'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.

no more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.

whether it's the war or katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.

the party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
i've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
that we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
as commander-in-chief, i will never hesitate to defend this nation, but i will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
now, i don't believe that senator mccain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of americans.
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement?
now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single american.
i've seen it in illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
it's not because john mccain doesn't care.
and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
no health care?
not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
if you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
i've seen it in washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
the truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - senator mccain has been anything but independent.
the chairman of the joint chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in north korea, we’d have to largely rely on the navy and air force to take care of it, since the army and marines are engaged elsewhere.
this means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in america by the end of the next president's first term.
i want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis.
for the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.",32.0
party,"doc3.txt,doc2.txt,doc1.txt","and so i am eager to have this argument not just with the president, but the entire republican party over what this country is about.
he was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the democrats should come down to just two words:
let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all americans.
that in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every american an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
the party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.

the party that won't make americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
the party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
the party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies.
the party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
and let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent america.
so let us agree that patriotism has no party.
we are the party of kennedy.
we are the party of roosevelt.
and next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.
i've seen it in washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.

if you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
in the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in america, our destiny is inextricably linked.
tonight, i say to the american people, to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough!
and now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in washington, the american people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
a few tuesdays ago, the american people embraced this seriousness with regards to america’s policy in iraq.
the president should announce to the iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in u.s. forces.
in each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the american people ?
the american people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
the american people have been extraordinarily resolved.
today, the iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the iraqi people or stabilize the country.
do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the american people.
the kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.
a foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
today, we're starting to see that the kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
when people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
i know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
but while corruption is a problem we all share, here in kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
the kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
the history of africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like nkrumah and kenyatta and mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from ghana to south africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
and we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
in a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
in the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
the kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
and i know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
looking out at this crowd of young people, i have faith that you will fight this fight too.
one that serves its people and is free from corruption.
to begin with, i discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
outstanding career officials who run the nunn-lugar program -- people like col. jim reid and andy weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that u.s. interests are protected.
now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the cooperative threat reduction program, dick lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
we're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
it was here, in springfield, where north, south, east and west come together that i was reminded of the essential decency of the american people - where i came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful america.
but through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.
for that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
it is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as americans.
in the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
that beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
i saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
it was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
but too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.

that's the promise of america - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that i am my brother's keeper; i am my sister's keeper.
now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why i've laid out how i'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help america grow.
and i will not settle for an america where some kids don't have that chance.
unlike john mccain, i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america.
they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america.
four years ago, i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in america, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
that won't keep america safe.
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
and i will restore our moral standing, so that america is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
america, we cannot turn back.
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring.
america, now is not the time for small plans.
it's time for us to change america.
america, this is one of those moments.
but what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in america, our destiny is inextricably linked.
i'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america.
america, our work will not be easy.
thank you, and god bless the united states of america.
america, we are better than these last eight years.
we need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats america now faces ?

let's be the generation that ends poverty in america.
let's be the generation that finally frees america from the tyranny of oil.
let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america.
america, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
it was here, in springfield, where i saw all that is america converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
it was here, in springfield, where north, south, east and west come together that i was reminded of the essential decency of the american people - where i came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful america.
and i accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that i might play a small part in building a better america.

you know, we all remember that george bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building.
he was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the democrats should come down to just two words:
let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all americans.

let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent america.
when john mccain said we could just ""muddle through"" in afghanistan, i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
in that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
he said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this president.
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.
and when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a ""mental recession,"" and that we've become, and i quote, ""a nation of whiners.""
for eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
a year in which well-respected republicans like john warner, former administration officials like colin powell, generals who have served in iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
the chairman of the joint chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in north korea, we’d have to largely rely on the navy and air force to take care of it, since the army and marines are engaged elsewhere.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one.
as i said at the outset, i did not know my father well - he returned to kenya from america when i was still young.
at this point i turned around and said ""hey, where's lugar?
he looked at me and said, ""been there, done that.""

whether it's the war or katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
it allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
they can say that this was the time when america found its way.
we are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say ""yes"" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
it lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to mexico or china - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
and then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when america renewed its purpose.
and in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
now, let me say this - i don't think that george bush is a bad man.
john mccain likes to say that he'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
on november 4th, we must stand up and say: ""eight is enough.""
senator mccain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
tonight, i say to the american people, to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land - enough!
i refuse to accept the possibility that i will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.

and so i am eager to have this argument not just with the president, but the entire republican party over what this country is about.
he was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the democrats should come down to just two words:
it's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.

will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
i've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
we are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say ""yes"" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
and i've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
so don't tell me that democrats won't defend this country.
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to china, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
you see, we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
the republican nominee, john mccain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
i love this country, and so do you, and so does john mccain.
we may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, i think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
we all put our country first.
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight.
because next week, in minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third.
this country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
we are a better country than this.
these are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in iraq ?
a year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan iraq study group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
today, the iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the iraqi people or stabilize the country.
that policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.
but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
we cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
it is time to give iraqis their country back.
the first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
as a senator from the united states, i believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with kenya and with africa.
today, we're starting to see that the kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
when people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
by focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
since that time i have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those i heard from my relatives here in kenya on my last trip to this country.
of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
we know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
and you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger kenya where everyone rises together.
i don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
his ideas about how kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
by rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
and i know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
you enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
i know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of kenyans still live in poverty.
it's humbling, but in my heart i know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
for that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.

the reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.

these are americans who still believe in an america where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.

i don't think this administration is full of stupid people - i think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
and i think that we face one of those moments today.
now, let me say this - i don't think that george bush is a bad man.
because i think that this is our moment to lead.
senator mccain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?

i just think he doesn't know.
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, i think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
we need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats america now faces ?
as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
if the iranians and syrians think they can use iraq as another afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
i don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
for any of these efforts that i've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about washington's relationship with moscow.
but, when i think about what is at stake i am reminded by a quote from the late president kennedy given in a speech at american university in 1963 about threats posed by the soviet union.

for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11, i stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
when john mccain said we could just ""muddle through"" in afghanistan, i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
so let us agree that patriotism has no party.
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
our government should work for us, not against us.
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f. kennedy called our ""intellectual and moral strength.""
don't tell me that democrats won't keep us safe.
yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
we have the most powerful military on earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
instead, it is that american spirit - that american promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
it should help us, not hurt us.
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from washington.
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, i think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
it's time for us to change america.
it's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
this country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
let us keep that promise - that american promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
we know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and iran’s nuclear ambitions.
as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
there is one other place where our mistakes in iraq have cost us dearly ?
it is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with iran and syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
and this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on united states soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
throughout american history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
no, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
the overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
the conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ?
and then there are anonymous kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
i know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator.
""let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...for in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes.
we entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
and if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as i see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as i sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then i'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
what's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
he tells us that there is power in words.
he tells us that there is power in conviction.
it will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth.
each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
in the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
what's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
let us begin this hard work together.
let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
he tells us that there is power in hope.
it must be about us - it must be about what we can do together.
politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
all of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
so let us begin.
let us be the generation that begins this work.
let us transform this nation.
and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
but let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.

but i will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
the president’s decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
and the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.

it is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.

our government should work for us, not against us.
yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes.
but we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
i've seen it in washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?
we can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
instead of consolidating the gains made by the karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.
that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure iraq.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
when possible, this should be done in consultation with the iraqi government ?
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
the first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the iraqi government ?
like many nations across this continent, where kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
an accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.
and we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
in a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
so if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
in the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
while the government of ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.

“rejected the notion of an american ‘timeline’ for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.”

because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
you have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from washington.
america, this is one of those moments.
for eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
let me emphasize one vital point ?
i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one.
there is one other place where our mistakes in iraq have cost us dearly ?
i spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about iraq that was similar to the one i did today.
rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
in fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in kenya or somewhere else.
and this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
it can shield a war criminal - even one like felicien kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
the kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
one statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise.

now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the cooperative threat reduction program, dick lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.

this does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.

the kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.

we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the american promise has been threatened once more.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
the national intelligence estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
this must end in the next session of congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.

that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.
and i believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.

americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
for the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
the second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
and now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in washington, the american people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
this kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
and a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al qaeda is successfully using the war in iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on america.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.
but for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither kenya nor the african continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to hiv/aids or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.

of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.

it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every american who's willing to work.

the american soldiers i met when i traveled to iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
and now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in washington, the american people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
300,000 iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet american troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
a few tuesdays ago, the american people embraced this seriousness with regards to america’s policy in iraq.
in each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the american people ?
“rejected the notion of an american ‘timeline’ for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.”
the american people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before american troops arrived.
and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
the american people have been extraordinarily resolved.
but instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in american history.
and polls show that almost two-thirds of all iraqis now sympathize with attacks on american soldiers.
and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the american people.
it’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own.
the addition of 4,000 american troops in baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.
throughout american history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
my own city of chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in american history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
but, when i think about what is at stake i am reminded by a quote from the late president kennedy given in a speech at american university in 1963 about threats posed by the soviet union.

as i said at the outset, i did not know my father well - he returned to kenya from america when i was still young.

why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?
a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
the notion that iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the middle east was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
it was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell.
we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
and this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on united states soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.
what's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.

kenya, like many african nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
terrorist attacks - like those that have shed kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of kenyans walking the streets of nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.

as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
but i have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
we should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
but even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like iran and syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
the second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
but we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
senators, republican and democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in iraq.

some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
and we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
what's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
and corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against u.s. troops.

“rejected the notion of an american ‘timeline’ for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.”
the security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
but neither iran nor syria want to see a security vacuum in iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
in a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
for years, nunn-lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former soviet union.
this does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.
but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.

we need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.

certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary kenyans - we know how hard kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that kenyan mothers make for their children, the herculean efforts that kenyan fathers make for their families.
and you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger kenya where everyone rises together.

and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
i will end this war in iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan.
you don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq.
the american soldiers i met when i traveled to iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
the national intelligence estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
any u.s. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in iraq.
“rejected the notion of an american ‘timeline’ for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.”
that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure iraq.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan, we will answer nato’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
if the iranians and syrians think they can use iraq as another afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
the president’s decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
there is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in iraq.
a year in which well-respected republicans like john warner, former administration officials like colin powell, generals who have served in iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time.
these are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in iraq ?
last week, without a trace of irony, the president even chose vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in iraq.
a few tuesdays ago, the american people embraced this seriousness with regards to america’s policy in iraq.
i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one.
namely, preventing iraq from becoming what afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the middle east, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell.
and so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in iraq.
this is now the reality of iraq.
the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
it may be politically advantageous for the president to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in iraq.
senators, republican and democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in iraq.
the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
the notion that iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the middle east was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
there is one other place where our mistakes in iraq have cost us dearly ?
they have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in iraq.
the time for waiting in iraq is over.
we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society.
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
now, i am hopeful that the iraq study group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
the overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
so far, congress has given the administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in iraq.
a year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan iraq study group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
and a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al qaeda is successfully using the war in iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on america.
as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before american troops arrived.
i spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about iraq that was similar to the one i did today.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
finally, we have to realize that the entire middle east has an enormous stake in the outcome of iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
but neither iran nor syria want to see a security vacuum in iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in iraq.
to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq.

it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f. kennedy called our ""intellectual and moral strength.""

as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
and the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
in today's kenya - a kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
but for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither kenya nor the african continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to hiv/aids or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
but we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from africa to afghanistan.
one way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the cooperative threat reduction effort.",11.0

we need to be sure that nunn-lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.

when john mccain said we could just ""muddle through"" in afghanistan, i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.

to president clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to ted kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice president of the united states, joe biden, i thank you.
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight.
and this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on united states soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?

i know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.

and so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.

the chairman of the joint chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in north korea, we’d have to largely rely on the navy and air force to take care of it, since the army and marines are engaged elsewhere.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?

when john mccain said we could just ""muddle through"" in afghanistan, i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
as commander-in-chief, i will never hesitate to defend this nation, but i will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
and, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
and all the troops in the world won’t be able to force shia, sunni, and kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
namely, preventing iraq from becoming what afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the middle east, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan, we will answer nato’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before american troops arrived.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
we cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
we need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
the addition of 4,000 american troops in baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.
if we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
the overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against u.s. troops.

he said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this president.
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president - when the average american family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under george bush.
we need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.
to president clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to ted kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice president of the united states, joe biden, i thank you.
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states.
so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president.
americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
last week, without a trace of irony, the president even chose vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in iraq.
the president should announce to the iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in u.s. forces.
what is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the president to respond to iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
it may be politically advantageous for the president to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in iraq.
much of what president kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
but, when i think about what is at stake i am reminded by a quote from the late president kennedy given in a speech at american university in 1963 about threats posed by the soviet union.
and that is why, in the shadow of the old state capitol, where lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, i stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the united states.
all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.",20.0

americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
the national intelligence estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.

of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell.
but even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society.

the second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
300,000 iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet american troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
the president should announce to the iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in u.s. forces.
we should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
the security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
it’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own.
especially special forces ?
terrorist attacks - like those that have shed kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of kenyans walking the streets of nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
and corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.

the kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.

four years ago, i stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in america, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
since that time i have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those i heard from my relatives here in kenya on my last trip to this country.
like many nations across this continent, where kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
in many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of kenya, and indeed, the african continent as a whole.
the hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
kenya, like many african nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
to begin with, i discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
but for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither kenya nor the african continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to hiv/aids or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
but, kenya must do its part.
this is the kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
it's more than just history and outside influences that explain why kenya lags behind.
and you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger kenya where everyone rises together.
in early 1960's, as kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of south korea.
in today's kenya - a kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
the first time i came to kenya was in 1987.
kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.
as i said at the outset, i did not know my father well - he returned to kenya from america when i was still young.
the world knows the names of wangari maathai and john githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened kenya.
as a senator from the united states, i believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with kenya and with africa.
in fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in kenya or somewhere else.
third, kenya is hurt from factors unique to africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
but while corruption is a problem we all share, here in kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
i began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the university of hawaii and harvard university to the respected economist that he was upon his return to kenya.
his ideas about how kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
among african nations, kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in kenya.",29.0

of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.
in a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.

the national intelligence estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
and a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al qaeda is successfully using the war in iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on america.
and on a trip to the former soviet union, i have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
we must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
we've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
and as we speak, members of al qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.

corruption,"doc3.txt,doc4.txt","in a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
the world knows the names of wangari maathai and john githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened kenya.
in fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in kenya or somewhere else.
and this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in kenya.
of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
but while corruption is a problem we all share, here in kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate.
by rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
it is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
and corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
the kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
what's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
corruption is not a new problem.
terrorist attacks - like those that have shed kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of kenyans walking the streets of nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.

the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight.
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.

threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in iraq.

but neither iran nor syria want to see a security vacuum in iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.

i don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
so if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
it is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
but we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from africa to afghanistan.
not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
one way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the cooperative threat reduction effort.
by destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference.
i saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.

americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
this doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.

americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.

in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
the first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the iraqi government ?
a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.

and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
we should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
and on a trip to the former soviet union, i have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.

this is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the soviet biological weapons program.
but this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
and as we speak, members of al qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
in a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
we've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
while the government of ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
but because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
i want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.
but we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from africa to afghanistan.
fortunately, the success of cooperative threat reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
we must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.
on our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.

the second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
300,000 iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet american troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
the president should announce to the iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in u.s. forces.
the first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the iraqi government ?
we can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
“rejected the notion of an american ‘timeline’ for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.”
but it should not depend on iraqi approval.
to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
today, the iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the iraqi people or stabilize the country.
when possible, this should be done in consultation with the iraqi government ?
we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society.
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
who are deployed with iraqi as units advisers.
when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
an increase in the quality and quantity of u.s. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.",25.0

the second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
these are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in iraq ?
moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
any u.s. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in iraq.
as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
and that strategy must change.
the first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the iraqi government ?
no, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.

i know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
the kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.

and now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in washington, the american people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one.
namely, preventing iraq from becoming what afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the middle east, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
“rejected the notion of an american ‘timeline’ for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.”
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell.
the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
but we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
it suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
what's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.

and on a trip to the former soviet union, i have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
right now, there are forces within the former soviet union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in chechnya, russian meddling in the former soviet union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
for years, nunn-lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former soviet union.
but, when i think about what is at stake i am reminded by a quote from the late president kennedy given in a speech at american university in 1963 about threats posed by the soviet union.
throughout the cold war, the soviet union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.
with the situation in russia and the rest of the former soviet union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
i want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better america.

the history of africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like nkrumah and kenyatta and mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from ghana to south africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary kenyans - we know how hard kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that kenyan mothers make for their children, the herculean efforts that kenyan fathers make for their families.
but for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither kenya nor the african continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to hiv/aids or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.",4.0

for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
when i first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, i had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.
the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
he should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.
when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.",8.0

of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.

one of the most important steps is for russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.
but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.

right now, there are forces within the former soviet union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
this is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the soviet biological weapons program.
additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in chechnya, russian meddling in the former soviet union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
we've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
for years, nunn-lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former soviet union.
but because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
but, when i think about what is at stake i am reminded by a quote from the late president kennedy given in a speech at american university in 1963 about threats posed by the soviet union.
throughout the cold war, the soviet union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.
with the situation in russia and the rest of the former soviet union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?",12.0

a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
any u.s. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in iraq.
the president should announce to the iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in u.s. forces.
in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
an increase in the quality and quantity of u.s. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.

this is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the soviet biological weapons program.
